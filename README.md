This is the repository for my course Software Design & Patterns (CS-665).</br>
This repository contains all the assignments, each exploring different design patterns and their use cases. The final project, in particular, is a comprehensive demonstration of event-driven architecture using the template method pattern.</br>
I'm eager to hear your thoughts on each work and would appreciate any guidelines you can provide to improve my work.</br>
